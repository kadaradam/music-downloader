### Running the API without Docker

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd app/server-sst
   ```
2. Install dependencies using Bun:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Define your FFmpeg path in the `convert-queue-subscriber.py` file. Search for: `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg`
4. Start a dev stage with SST:
   ```bash
   npx sst dev
   ```
5. Look for the api and websocket endpoint in the terminal output and use it to interact with the API.
